# Prison-Break
A maze-escape game built in Java using Processing. Unlike the hit FOX series of the same name, there are no cool tattoos, no dramatic conspiracies, and — tragically — no budget for Wentworth Miller.

Instead, you play as a pixel-sized Michael Scofield armed with nothing but a flickering lighter and a questionable sense of direction.

The task is simple in theory: navigate a gloomy labyrinth, avoid guards who have nothing better to do, and reach the exit in the bottom-right corner. In practice, you’ll find yourself colliding with walls, running headfirst into policemen, and questioning is there more danger?

## Controls

Controls are the usual suspects:

* **WASD / Arrow Keys** → Move
* **P** → Pause (when the stress becomes too much)

For the *adventurous*:

* **Hard Mode** → Doubles your speed *and* the guard patrols, because apparently you weren’t suffering enough already.

---

Play it for the atmosphere, stay for the frustration. Scofield would be proud. *Probably.*
